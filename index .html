        <p>Hello, my name is Bret Shroats and, I would like to welcome you to my portfolio website. I am located in Richmond, KY 
and I work as a priority team call center rep for CLC Lodging in Lexington, KY.
     I have had various customer service jobs between call centers to theme parks. My favorite job I have worked was working for the Walt Disney Company.</p>
<p>However, I am hoping to chart down a new career. I graduated from the University of the Cumberlands. I received a Bachelor of Science in
 Information Technology with a concentration in Management. Although I have graduated from school, the learning has not stopped.
 I believe you should never stop learning. I am currently learning Python and Java Script independently from school through various online resources. </p>
