 <p>Hello, my name is Bret Shroats and, I would like to welcome you to my portfolio website. I am located in Richmond, KY 
     and I work as a priority team call center rep for CLC Lodging in Lexington, KY.
    I have had various customer service jobs between call centers to theme parks. My favorite job I have worked was working for the 
    Walt Disney Company.<br> <br>
    However, I am hoping to chart down a new career. I graduated from the University of the Cumberlands. I received a Bachelor of Science in
     Information Technology with a concentration in Management. Although I have graduated from school, the learning has not stopped.
     I believe you should never stop learning. I am currently learning Python and Java Script independently from school through various online 
     resources. </p> </div>
