 <p>Hello, my name is Bret Shroats and, I would like to welcome you to my portfolio website. I am located in Richmond, KY and I work as a priority team call center rep for CLC Lodging in Lexington, KY. I have had various customer service jobs between call centers to theme parks. My favorite job I have worked was working for the Walt Disney Company.

    However, I am hoping to chart down a new career. I graduated from the 
    University of the Cumberlands. I received a Bachelor of Science in 
    Information Technology with a concentration in Management. Although I 
    have graduated from school, the learning has not stopped. I believe 
    you should never stop learning. I am currently learning Python and 
    Java Script independently from school through various 
    online resources.</p>
